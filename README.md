# Learn English

Learn English is a web application to help people to learn English.
Users can create their own accounts and then start learning, so they do not lose their progress and can compete with friends in the ranking section.
They can sign up and then login to see the lessons, or if they already have an account they can just login and start learning.
User can find lessons to learn present simple, past simple and future simple, in which they can see an explanatory video, some examples and a link for a test.
They can do this test for evaluating all these topics, and they can do it long as they want, so no pressure!
In the ranking section users can compete with their friends by seeing who has the highest score, which makes learning more interesting and fun.

# Technoligies

This web application was built using the following technologies:

- Flask: this is the framework that allowed me to create the web application with python.
- HTML: for structuring the webpages.
- CSS: for adding styles to the webpages.
- SQL: for storing users' information in a database.
